  <h2>When speed becomes the constraint</h2>

  <p>
    In senior design roles, urgency often arrives without warning. Executive input,
    shifting priorities, or external deadlines can compress timelines dramatically,
    sometimes after work is already in progress.
  </p>

  <p>
    These moments test more than design skill — they test judgment.

  <div class="label">The Pressure</div>
  <h2>Incomplete information, complete accountability</h2>

  <p>
    I’ve worked in environments where leadership requests came late in the process
    but carried significant weight. The expectation wasn’t perfection — it was
    confidence, clarity, and momentum.
  </p>

  <p>
    The challenge wasn’t just deciding what to do, but deciding what <em>not</em> to do
    given the constraints.
  </p>

<section id="decisions">
  <div class="label">Decision-Making</div>
  <h2>Progress over idealism</h2>

  <p>
    In these situations, I focus on three questions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What decision reduces the most risk right now?</li>
    <li>What can be iterated later without harming trust?</li>
    <li>How do I protect my team from unnecessary churn?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Rather than pushing for a perfect solution, I aim for the strongest defensible
    option under the circumstances — and clearly communicate the tradeoffs involved.

  <h2>Clarity builds confidence</h2>

  <p>
    In practice, this approach has helped teams move forward decisively while
    maintaining credibility with leadership. Designers stay focused, and product
    partners understand the reasoning behind decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, these moments build trust — not because every outcome is ideal, but
    because decisions are thoughtful and grounded.
  </p>

  <div class="label">Reflection</div>
  <h2>Leadership is situational</h2>

  <p>
    Designing under pressure isn’t about having the right answer — it’s about
    providing direction when certainty isn’t possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good leadership in these moments comes from experience, empathy, and a steady
    hand.
