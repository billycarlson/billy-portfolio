  <h2>When speed becomes the constraint</h2>

<p>
Design quality doesn’t drift upward on its own. In every organization I’ve worked
in, the craft bar was set implicitly by what leaders noticed, questioned, and
modeled.
</p>

<p>
Early in my management career, I learned that stepping too far away from the work
created ambiguity. Designers didn’t know what “good” really meant, and feedback
became inconsistent or overly subjective.
</p>

<h2>Craft needs to be visible</h2>

<p>
At one point, I was managing a team where output was steady, but something felt
off. Screens technically met requirements, but they lacked clarity, hierarchy,
and polish. The work wasn’t bad — it was just safe.
</p>

<p>
In critiques, designers often asked, “Is this okay?” instead of “Is this right?”
That question told me everything.
</p>

<h2>Shifting critique from approval to thinking</h2>

<p>
Rather than issuing directives or redesigning work myself, I shifted how critique
worked. Instead of starting with opinions, I asked designers to explain intent:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What should users notice first?</li>
  <li>What decision are we helping them make?</li>
  <li>What would break if this were removed?</li>
</ul>

<p>
We slowed critiques down just enough to make thinking visible. Over time, designers
began preempting feedback — addressing hierarchy, spacing, and typography before
anyone asked.
</p>

<h2>Leading by doing, not hovering</h2>

<p>
I stayed close to the work without micromanaging. In high-stakes moments, I’d
personally take on key flows or presentations, not to control outcomes, but to
model standards under pressure.
</p>

<p>
That visibility mattered. Designers could see how decisions were made when time
was tight, tradeoffs were real, and expectations were high.
</p>

<h2>What changed over time</h2>

<p>
As critique became more thoughtful and consistent, something subtle shifted. The
team stopped asking for approval and started asking better questions. Craft became
a shared responsibility rather than a personal preference.
</p>

<p>
Quality rose not because of enforcement, but because expectations were clear and
reinforced through action.
</p>

<h2>What I believe now</h2>

<p>
Strong design leadership doesn’t mean doing all the best work — it means making
good work inevitable. That only happens when leaders stay connected to craft,
language, and decision-making.
</p>

<p>
Being a player–coach isn’t about control. It’s about trust, clarity, and shared
standards.
