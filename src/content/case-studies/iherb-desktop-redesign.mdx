    <h2>A high-visibility surface under pressure</h2>
    <p>
      The desktop homepage at iHerb is one of the most visible and scrutinized surfaces in
      the product. It sits at the intersection of marketing priorities, executive
      expectations, and long-term platform considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I stepped into this project, the request was clear but incomplete: update the
      homepage to better reflect the brand and support evolving business goals—quickly.

    <h2>The constraint wasn't design — it was pressure</h2>
    <p>
      The homepage had accumulated years of incremental changes. Different teams had
      touched it with good intent, but without a unifying vision. Visual inconsistency,
      content sprawl, and competing priorities made the experience feel fragmented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complicating matters, feedback was coming directly from executive leadership. The
      timeline was compressed, expectations were high, and alignment across teams was
      still forming.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wasn't a scenario where design could disappear into exploration. We needed to
      be decisive.

<section id="approach">
  <div class="label">Approach</div>
  <h2>How I navigated the work</h2>
  <p>
    The approach focused on creating clarity before optimization—establishing a vision that could align stakeholders before diving into implementation details.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="vision" class="two-col">
  <div class="section-text">
    <div class="label">Vision First</div>
    <h2>Choosing vision before optimization</h2>
    <p>
      Rather than starting with incremental tweaks, I proposed a different approach:
      create a future-state desktop homepage that clarified where we were going before
      deciding how far we could realistically move in the near term.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reframing helped shift conversations away from individual modules and toward
      overall structure, hierarchy, and intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal wasn't to ship everything immediately. It was to create a north star that
      teams could align around.
    </p>

<section id="alignment" class="two-col">
  <div class="section-text">
    <div class="label">Designing for Alignment</div>
    <h2>Designing for alignment, not just approval</h2>
    <p>The design work focused on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarifying visual hierarchy across content types</li>
      <li>Reducing cognitive load by grouping related information</li>
      <li>Establishing more consistent patterns for promotions and discovery</li>
      <li>Making brand expression feel intentional rather than decorative</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Just as important as the design itself was how it was presented. I treated reviews
      as alignment moments, not just checkpoints.

<section id="tradeoffs" class="two-col">
  <div class="section-text">
    <div class="label">Navigating Tradeoffs</div>
    <h2>Navigating tradeoffs without losing trust</h2>
    <p>
      Not everything in the future vision could ship immediately. Technical constraints,
      dependencies with mobile teams, and ongoing experiments required prioritization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of defending every detail, I focused on explaining tradeoffs clearly:
      what mattered now, what could wait, and why.
    </p>
    <p>
      This transparency helped maintain momentum while avoiding false expectations.

    <h2>From deliverable to reference point</h2>
    <p>
      The future-state design became a reference point rather than a one-off deliverable.
      It informed subsequent iterations, helped onboard new partners, and reduced
      reactive redesign cycles.
    </p>
    <p>
      More importantly, it repositioned design as a strategic contributor — not just an
      executor responding to feedback.

    <h2>Clarity matters more than completeness</h2>
    <p>
      High-visibility projects often test more than design skill. They test judgment,
      communication, and leadership under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project reinforced a lesson I've learned repeatedly: when stakes are high,
      clarity matters more than completeness.
