    <h2>Replacing manual reporting with a digital-first experience</h2>
    <p>
      Momentum is a new product inside KPMG's One Port ecosystem designed to replace the manual, PDF-based "360 Review" reporting process with a scalable, collaborative, digital-first experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal was straightforward but ambitious: shift from reporting as an afterthought at the end of an engagement to an experience that builds ongoing value, confidence, and client momentum throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Design Lead and player/coach, I guided the UX vision, workflow design, user journeys, and collaboration frameworks with engineering to define and deliver the MVP. We completed and aligned on a working MVP build with engineering, approved for internal rollout.

    <h2>The fragmented manual process</h2>
    <p>
      The prior 360 Report process relied on Word templates, spreadsheets, exported PDFs, and ad-hoc data collection. This made the experience inconsistent and difficult to scale.
    </p>
    <p>Key challenges:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fragmented process across multiple tools</li>
      <li>Knowledge is not retained or reused year-over-year</li>
      <li>Dense PDF reports overwhelm clients</li>
      <li>Inconsistent confidence for partners before client conversations</li>
      <li>Little exposure or clarity for junior staff</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Business impact: reduced scalability, missed opportunities for strategic conversations, and inconsistent delivery quality.

  <div class="label">Approach</div>
  <h2>Multi-stage progression from process to product</h2>
  <p>
    The default behavior in many organizations is to jump straight to polished UI. Instead, I led a multi-stage progression that started with mapping the real current state, redesigning the process before designing screens, and building low-fidelity prototypes to expose unknowns.
  </p>

    <h2>Start intentionally low fidelity, build alignment, scale quality</h2>
    <p>
      This project exemplified the process I teach: start intentionally low fidelity, build alignment, and scale quality with clarity. We validated with stakeholders and engineering early, moved to high fidelity when clarity was earned, then prototyped and documented for build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why this mattered: This prevented fantasy features disconnected from engineering feasibility, aligned teams earlier, and ensured the design system integration reflected real workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I owned experience strategy and product direction, MVP scope and prioritization with engineering, cross-functional workshops and working sessions, interaction and systems design, and lo-fi to hi-fi progression and engineering alignment.

    <h2>From deliverable-first to value-first</h2>
    <p>
      A core design shift was moving from a "make a deliverable" mindset to a "build value collaboratively" mindset. Builder Mode introduced a workspace where content is built as engagements progress, not rushed at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reports can be created at the engagement, entity, or client group level, establishing a single source of truth with governance, audit trails, and role-based access. This supports clear ownership and accountability, cross-service collaboration, repeatability year over year, and a traceable history of decisions and context.
    </p>
    <p>
      Core modules included in the MVP: Screener questions (structured inputs), financial data ingestion and validation, industry insights via Interval integration, opportunities and x-sell surfacing, resource library tab, and publishing governance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reframed Momentum as a year-round asset rather than a one-time deliverable.

    <h2>Meeting real-world client variability</h2>
    <p>
      To meet real-world client variability, we designed three ingestion paths: Caseware API (preferred path with structured automation), Excel Template (mid-tier data maturity, no API required), and PDF OCR (fallback to ensure no client is blocked).
    </p>
    <p>
      This protected the experience against inconsistent data maturity and expanded the addressable audience for MVP. The ability to pull mapped financial data via CaseWare API, with Excel and OCR as fallback ingestion paths, ensured we could serve clients regardless of their technical readiness.

    <h2>Clarity replaced workload and guesswork</h2>
    <p>
      We achieved approved MVP build in collaboration with engineering, alignment across Tax, Assurance, Audit, Product, and Engineering, and established a foundation for a scalable platform release within One Port.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usability and clarity replaced workload and guesswork. The cultural shift moved from deliverable-first to value-first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most impactful outcome was not a screen. It was the shared belief that this product could exist—and that it could be built responsibly.

    <h2>What I'm most proud of</h2>
    <p>
      I'm most proud of applying the low-to-high fidelity approach I teach in my book, avoiding premature visual polish, and using UX to drive alignment, not decoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      We established a working foundation that engineering could build on and created clarity around what "better" looks like at scale. This project demonstrated how starting with process and collaboration, rather than jumping to polished UI, leads to more robust and buildable solutions.
