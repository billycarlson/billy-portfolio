  <h2>Growth exposes inconsistency</h2>

  <p>
    As organizations scale, design inconsistencies become more visible. Teams move
    fast, but without shared standards, products begin to fragment.

  <h2>Adoption is harder than creation</h2>

  <p>
    Building components is relatively easy. Getting teams to trust and use them
    consistently is not.
  </p>

  <p>
    The real challenge is aligning incentives, workflows, and expectations across
    disciplines.

  <h2>Design systems as shared language</h2>

  <p>
    I treat design systems as organizational infrastructure — something that enables
    better decisions, not just faster production.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Focus on clarity over completeness</li>
    <li>Involve engineering early</li>
    <li>Anchor standards to real product needs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Consistency without rigidity</h2>

  <p>
    When design systems are positioned as tools rather than rules, adoption improves.
    Teams move faster with fewer debates and better outcomes.

  <h2>Systems succeed when people believe in them</h2>

  <p>
    The success of a design system depends less on its documentation and more on the
    relationships that support it.
