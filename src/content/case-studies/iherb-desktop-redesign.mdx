<p>
The desktop homepage at iHerb is one of the most visible and scrutinized surfaces in
the product. It sits at the intersection of marketing priorities, executive
expectations, and long-term platform considerations.
</p>

<p>
When I stepped into this project, the request was clear but incomplete: update the
homepage to better reflect the brand and support evolving business goals—quickly.
</p>

<h2>The constraint wasn’t design — it was pressure</h2>

<p>
The homepage had accumulated years of incremental changes. Different teams had
touched it with good intent, but without a unifying vision. Visual inconsistency,
content sprawl, and competing priorities made the experience feel fragmented.
</p>

<p>
Complicating matters, feedback was coming directly from executive leadership. The
timeline was compressed, expectations were high, and alignment across teams was
still forming.
</p>

<p>
This wasn’t a scenario where design could disappear into exploration. We needed to
be decisive.

<h2>Choosing vision before optimization</h2>

<p>
Rather than starting with incremental tweaks, I proposed a different approach:
create a future-state desktop homepage that clarified where we were going before
deciding how far we could realistically move in the near term.
</p>

<p>
This reframing helped shift conversations away from individual modules and toward
overall structure, hierarchy, and intent.
</p>

<p>
The goal wasn’t to ship everything immediately. It was to create a north star that
teams could align around.
</p>

<h2>Designing for alignment, not just approval</h2>

<p>
The design work focused on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clarifying visual hierarchy across content types</li>
  <li>Reducing cognitive load by grouping related information</li>
  <li>Establishing more consistent patterns for promotions and discovery</li>
  <li>Making brand expression feel intentional rather than decorative</li>
</ul>

<p>
Just as important as the design itself was how it was presented. I treated reviews
as alignment moments, not just checkpoints.
</p>

<h3>🧠 ADD REAL-WORLD STORY HERE</h3>
<p><strong>What to add:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>A specific executive review moment</li>
  <li>What feedback surprised you</li>
  <li>How you reframed concerns into design decisions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Navigating tradeoffs without losing trust</h2>

<p>
Not everything in the future vision could ship immediately. Technical constraints,
dependencies with mobile teams, and ongoing experiments required prioritization.
</p>

<p>
Instead of defending every detail, I focused on explaining tradeoffs clearly:
what mattered now, what could wait, and why.
</p>

<p>
This transparency helped maintain momentum while avoiding false expectations.

/>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>
The future-state design became a reference point rather than a one-off deliverable.
It informed subsequent iterations, helped onboard new partners, and reduced
reactive redesign cycles.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, it repositioned design as a strategic contributor — not just an
executor responding to feedback.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
High-visibility projects often test more than design skill. They test judgment,
communication, and leadership under pressure.
</p>

<p>
This project reinforced a lesson I’ve learned repeatedly: when stakes are high,
clarity matters more than completeness.
